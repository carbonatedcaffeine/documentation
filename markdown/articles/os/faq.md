# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What is dahliaOS?**
> dahliaOS is an operating system that aims to run on multiple kernels to take advantage of Fuchsia (Zircon)'s features but fall back to Linux.

**Where are the dahliaOS Fuchsia builds?**
> The Zircon-based builds are not ready yet. Much work is needed to make Pangolin, our desktop environment, able to run on Fuchsia.

**Is dahliaOS stable? Can I use it as a daily driver?**
> No. It is missing nearly everything a standard Linux distribution or even Fuchsia Workstation has, such as a proper web browser and apps. There are issues blocking us that we can't do anything about but we're finding short-term workarounds until these issues get resolved.

**How do I install dahliaOS?**
> You don't. Or, at least, you *shouldn't*. dahliaOS is not stable and is not ready for regular use. There is an installer planned, but it isn't useful yet.

**How do I install \_\_\_ on dahliaOS?**
> Select webapps can be installed using the Web App Manager.
> 
> Most apps, including desktop apps, cannot be installed at this time.

**What is Graft?**
> Graft is an upcoming VM, container, and chroot manager and integrator that serves as a core part of the dahliaOS experience, allowing you to use apps that aren't built for dahliaOS on dahliaOS.
> 
> Graft is currently unfinished
