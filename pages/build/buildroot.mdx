# Build dahliaOS with Buildroot

## Requirements

- Ethernet connection (reccommended for data downloads), a quad-core x86_64 CPU and at least 8 GiB of RAM when compiling.
- 4C/8T or better CPU with 10 GB of RAM for optimal speeds.
- Decent amount of hard drive space, around 64 GB is recommended if you clear out the build directory often.

It takes around 8 hours to build a full image from scratch on a Dell Optiplex 790 with a 3.0 GHz i5-2400 CPU and 16 GB of RAM.

<Steps>

### Install packages

1. Install Ubuntu-specific packages.

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-3-dev clang syslinux-utils ccd2iso docbook-xsl gobject-introspection cmake git ninja-build nano
```

2. Set up Flutter and Dart with Git by cloning Flutter to /var/lib/flutter/ and configuring permissions.

```sh
cd /var/lib; git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git; sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/lib/flutter/
```

3. Make a symlink to Flutter and Dart.

```sh
sudo ln -s /var/lib/flutter/bin/flutter /usr/bin/flutter; sudo ln -s /var/lib/flutter/bin/dart /usr/bin/dart
```

4. Add support for Flutter Linux desktop.

```sh
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
```

<Callout>
  If in the future you want to update Flutter and Dart, simply run `git pull` in
  `/var/lib/flutter/`.
</Callout>

### Building dahliaOS

1. Clone buildroot.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dahliaos/buildroot.git
```

3. Go into the cloned buildroot directory and run `make CLANG=1` or if you want to, you can first make changes to Busybox(init), Linux and Buildroot settings, once you're done just run `make CLANG=1`.

- `make busybox-menuconfig`
- `make linux-menuconfig`
- `make menuconfig`

2. After that is done, run the command below to recompile the image with Pangolin.

```sh
cp -rvf dahliaOS-overlays/* output/target; make CLANG=1
```

4. Once it's done, your ISO file should be in `output/target`!

</Steps>
